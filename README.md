# HTML Include Tag

A simple Javascript library that adds new HTML tag for importing code from another source.

## Usage

1) Import the code:
```html
<script src="include.js"></script> <!-- Preferred: Will work offline and much faster --->
<script src="https://github.com/Segilmez06/Include-Tag/releases/latest/download/include.js"></script>
```

2) Import your other HTML file:
```html
<include src="hello.html" />
```
